    <h2 style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Justice is a Marathon, not a Sprint</h2>
    <p>Social justice consciousness is more important than ever as systematic racism and injustice persists in the world around us. Educating one's self on these issues to empower and incite action towards racial justice is extremely important, and
      Justice Calendar provides tools and resources to do so in a digestible way. Justice Calendar is a simple Google Calendar integration tool designed for people who want to <b>learn more about racial injustice</b> happening in the world and what
      they can do about it by <b>allocating time for users to learn, listen, and reflect.</b></p>
    <p>Starting as a project for the UC Davis Design Interactive cohort, we continued working on Justice Calendar after the initial <b>five weeks</b> of the project to work part time with the professor as interaction designers.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Making the <b>commitment to contribute to racial justice and promote anti-racist behavior may be daunting</b> for folks who may not identify as people of color or have not had the experience to educate themselves on the matter.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>A tool that <b>reduces the barrier towards learning about racial injustice</b> and incites proactive actions towards anti-racist behavior. This is done in a way that creates a <b>habit of learning</b> and <b>progressive contributions
            towards social justice.</b></p>

    <p>Throughout our design process, each team member led a specific portion of it. However, we all collectively contributed to research, ideation, wireframing, and prototyping equally. </p>

    <h2>Design Process (5 Weeks)</h2>
    <img src="../assets/jc-timeline.svg" alt="Justice Calendar Timeline" id="timeline">

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Upon starting this sprint, we first consulted with our client, an assistant professor for the Design department at UC Davis. We discussed the initial concept and idea behind a calendar tool that would schedule time to learn about racial
      injustice and promote anti-racist actions.
      <br><br>
      After consulting with our client, we wanted to get a better understanding of what kind of commitment users are willing to make to learn more about racial injustice and how people consider their current general knowledge on it, so we created a
      <b>Google Form survey</b> with questions pertaining to these along with general information about respondents including their own ethnicities.
    </p>

    <p>Of the <b>81 respondents</b> to our survey, we saw that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>91.4%</b> of respondents identified as people of color</li>
      <li><b>51.9%</b> of respondents rated themselves at 3/5 on their level of knowledge on racial inequity. </li>
      <li><b>97.5%</b> of respondents were willing to commit at least 5 minutes to learn more</li>
      <li><b>61.7%</b> of respondents were willing to commit 15-45 minutes</li>
      <li><b>63%</b> of respondents primarily used google calendar to schedule commitments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Research Synthesis</h3>
    <p>From this collected data, we took away that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>People of all ethnicities</b> can learn more about racial injustice and have varying levels of knowledge</li>
      <li><b>People are willing to put in time</b> to learn more about racial injustice</li>
      <li><b>Google Calendar</b> is the most popular scheduling tool of the respondents</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ideation</h3>

    <h4>Experience Mapping</h4>
    <img src="../assets/jc-experiencemap.jpg" alt="Experience Map" class="dropshadow">
    <p>After gathering these user insights, we created an <b>experience map</b> of a potential user to better understand any <b>pain points</b> that might occur along the way when trying to learn about racial injustice. </p>

    <h4>Affinity Mapping</h4>
    <img src="../assets/jc-affinitymap.JPG" alt="Affinity Map" class="dropshadow">
    <p>After this, we generated an <b>affinity map</b> to organize these pain points and ideate some solutions to them. We did this by listing pain points as sticky notes and then organizing them into categories, helping our team get a better
      understanding of how <b>pain points may relate to each other and how to effectively tackle them</b>.</p>

    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>From this, we were able to create our problem statement: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em><b>"How might we encourage users to commit time each week to learn about racial injustice and set personal goals to spark understanding, self-reflection, and informed action?”</b></em></p>
    </blockquote>


    <h4>Wireframe Sketches</h4>
    <p>We looked at different scheduling apps that were mainly Google Chrome extensions. We took inspiration from numerous examples to help us understand how we should create our user flow and what kind of application we wanted to make for this,
      which we decided should be a Google Chrome extension as well. We thought about reflection objectives to increase retention and a reward system to help users commit to scheduling again. This ended with a couple wireframe sketches from me and
      the rest of our project group. The wireframes we sketched went over the scheduling process as well as the reflection interaction after viewing scheduled content.</p>

    <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>

    <img src="../assets/jc-lf2.jpg" alt="Low-Fidelity Prototypes" class="dropshadow">
    <p>We started with a low-fidelity prototype using <b>Figma</b> to create our app. We experimented with full size pages and interfaces that only took a small portion of the screen.
    </p>

    <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
    <img src="../assets/jc-hfdg.JPG" alt="High-Fidelity Design Guidelines" class="dropshadow">
    <p>We consulted with our client and our mentor to move onto our high-fidelity prototype, where we created <b>design guidelines</b> and worked to improve the <b>flow of our scheduling process.</b></p>

    <div class="hf-body">
      <div class="hf-text">
        <h4>Login & User Setup</h4>
        <p>From our low-fidelity prototype to our high-fidelity prototype, we wanted to ensure that the process of users getting started was <b>streamline and smooth.</b> Part of this process was the specific language used in each screen to provide
          a
          sense of guidance and comfort throughout the process. We wanted to ensure that users knew exactly what they're supposed to do and why they're doing it.</p>

        <h4>Fullscreen Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Users can access a larger dashboard with their scheduled content. User stats can <b>incite more engagement and promotes consistent use of Justice Calendar</b>. Reflections for certain materials may hold a lot of important and insightful
          information, so users can also access past reflections in their journal.</p>

    <h4>User Testing</h4>
    <p>
      We were able to conduct <b>testing with our client</b> at the time, and we continued to iterate on the <b>diction and intuitiveness of the first-time user flow</b>. At the end of the design sprint, our team presented our final version of the
      high-fidelity
      prototype to the rest of the cohort and other design professionals.
    </p>

    <h3>Further Development (6 Weeks)</h3>

    <h4>Working with our Client</h4>
    <img src="../assets/justice-calendar-web-mockup.jpg" alt="Justice Calendar with Further Development">
    <p>After concluding the project with Design Interactive, our client wanted to hire us for further development of the Justice Calendar project. One of the most prominent changes made in this extension of the project was the shift from a Google
      <b>Chrome extension to a web application</b>. Nonetheless, the interfaces still looked similar and were optimized for the larger interface size.
      <br><br>
      During these six additional weeks, we dove straight into ideations and prototyping to design and create
      this web application. This process was a lot more different than before though: we started <b>working with back-end developers</b> and collaborated often to ensure that the design and functionality worked together. The back-end developers
      were unfamiliar with front-end development, so our team of interaction designers took it upon ourselves to <b>learn a bit of front-end web development</b>. We were posed with the unique challenge of <b>learning CSS and web design
        principles</b> after working on our initial prototypes on Figma. We decided to try using <b>Webflow</b>, which simplified the CSS coding to a more intuitive interface while also being able to export to developers so that they can develop
      the back end with ease.
      <br><br>
      The site is now live at <a href="https://justicecalendar.org/" target="_blank">justicecalendar.org</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges and Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Remote Collaboration</h3>

    <p>This project posed a lot of unique challenges for me and every other member of our project team. Working together as a group was a bit challenging given that a member lived in <b>Australia</b> with the rest of us in the US, so we always had
      to work
      around the <b>differing time zones.</b></p>

    <h3>Learning Webflow (After the Design Sprint)</h3>
    <p>During our time working as hired designers for our client, we did not initially think that we’d be working partly as web designers as well. Most of our group was unfamiliar with coding in CSS or flexbox and other web design principles so we
      spent a lot of our working time just learning more about it. Our client had us work with the web development tool Webflow, so there was a slight learning curve as well when moving forward with this project</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This was my very first design sprint while working with a real client and my very first taste of what <b>real-world design work</b>. Although it was challenging and intimidating at first, I came out of this project with so much more
      experience and
      knowledge of the design process and working with clients. I got introduced to <b>research and ideation tools</b> that helped me learn to empathize with users and prioritize pain points. Out of all the other project groups in Design
      Interactive, our
      project group was the <b>only one to get hired by our client to continue our work</b>. I got the opportunity to work with <b>real web developers</b> and learn how to effectively communicate with them in developing the overall application.
