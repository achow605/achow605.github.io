      <h1>Hi, I'm <b>Anthony Chow</b></h1>
      <p>
        I’m a third-year at the University of California, Davis pursuing an
        individual major in Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I am a
        project mentor with <a href="https://davisdi.org/" target="_blank">Design Interactive</a>—the first student-run,
        human-centered design consultancy at UC Davis—and was a part of the
        first cohort of designers. I am also the Co-President of <a href="https://joinpase.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Pilipinx
          Americans in Science & Engineering (PASE)</a>, a student organization
        catering to Pilipinx folx in STEM related majors. I have previously
        been the Communications Coordinator for the University Honors Program
        and First-Year Seminars at UC Davis where I created graphics, flyers,
        handbooks, and other digital content.

        <br /><br />I am passionate about using human-centered design as a
        form of problem solving and digital story-telling. My journey started
        with me being interested in digital media and design since middle
        school, where I loved to make videos and play around with Adobe
        Photoshop and Illustrator. I came into UC Davis as a Computer Science
        major but felt stagnant, so after many difficult conversations and
        reflection I decided to create an individual major that combined all
        of the disciplines I was interested in including design, computer
        science, psychology, and statistics. I work closely with a few
        professors who serve as my major advisors as I navigate through my
        individual major.

        <br /><br />Through my experiences so far, I’ve learned so much about
        the design process and gaining new perspectives on problem solving
        through technical, design, and user-centered perspectives. I aim to
        take advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of my major and be able
        to utilize these multidisciplinary perspectives to find unique and
        effective solutions. Additionaly, I strive to continue serving and
        representing underserved and underrepresented communities as they
        continue to empower and strengthen me both in and out of academia.
