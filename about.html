        <h1>Hi, I'm <b>Anthony Chow</b></h1>
        <p>
          I’m a third-year at the University of California, Davis pursuing an
          individual major in Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I am a
          project mentor with <a href="https://davisdi.org/" target="_blank">Design Interactive</a>—the first student-run,
          human-centered design consultancy at UC Davis—and was a part of the
          first cohort of designers. I am also the Co-President of <a href="https://joinpase.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Pilipinx
          Americans in Science & Engineering (PASE)</a>, a student organization
          catering to Pilipinx folx in STEM related majors. I have previously
          been the Communications Coordinator for the University Honors Program
          and First-Year Seminars at UC Davis where I created graphics, flyers,
          handbooks, and other digital content.

          <br /><br />I am passionate about using human-centered design as a
          form of problem solving and digital story-telling. My journey started
          with me being interested in digital media and design since middle
          school, where I loved to make videos and play around with Adobe
          Photoshop and Illustrator. I came into UC Davis as a Computer Science
          major but felt stagnant, so after many difficult conversations and
          reflection I decided to create an individual major that combined all
          of the disciplines I was interested in including design, computer
          science, psychology, and statistics. I work closely with a few
          professors who serve as my major advisors as I navigate through my
          individual major.

          <br /><br />Through my experiences so far, I’ve learned so much about
          the design process and gaining new perspectives on problem solving
          through technical, design, and user-centered perspectives. I aim to
          take advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of my major and be able
          to utilize these multidisciplinary perspectives to find unique and
          effective solutions. Additionaly, I strive to continue serving and
          representing underserved and underrepresented communities as they
          continue to empower and strengthen me both in and out of academia.
