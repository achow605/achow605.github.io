      <h2>Best Practices for form design</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-01-21">Jan 21, 2021</time>
      <p>This article made some interesting points on what is good practice in designing forms. I didn't realize there were a lot of small details that make a huge impact on how readable and intuitive a form can be for a user. I thought it was interesting how the main priorities in the designs were to make understanding what to do as easy as possible while minimizing form abandonment. Another thing I thought was interesting was how I've seen forms with the 'bad practices' mentioned like the red asterisk on required question, although I don't really see this type of design in more modern forms. I thought the password requirement formatting was very useful to put because I've personally gotten annoyed on vague and uncommunicated requirements for passwords. </p>
