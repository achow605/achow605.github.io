      <p>The image that I chose was of a group of plants that I own at home. I think this image is interesting because it is a grouped display of all the plants I own that are the "Philodendron" genus. I think it's really interesting how even though
        they all come from the same family of plants they all look very unique in their own way. The topic that I wanted this to be a part of is a sort of collection display of all the plants that I own currently. Since I own so many types of plants,
        there are different ways for me to group them and I thought grouping them by genus would be interesting to see since I have plants of many genus. I believe this collection would shed light on how I see beauty in plants, especially in urban
        spaces. I wanted to feature beautiful images of all my plants to communicate how I see my plants in my space.</p>

      <p>This image my partner provided shows a tea drink from RareTea, a boba shop in Davis. This particular kind of drink is not a milk tea since it does not have any milk in it, but it is more like an iced sweet tea. Although there isn't too much
        going on in this picture on its own, I think that it is interesting how there are different kinds of drinks you can get from boba shops. In addition, each shop that sells these kinds of drinks all have different packaging. I think that the
        way that this photo was shot shows some unique colors in the drink itself, along with contrasting textures between the smooth cup and the texture of the table. I think the thing I'm most curious about is how this image will be incorporated in
        some sort of interaction. </p>

      <h2>Images and Interaction</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-02-03">Feb 3, 2021</time>
      <p>I thought that this article really touched upon the meaning behind "a picture is worth a thousand words". I feel that often we are so exposed to so many forms of media constantly that we don't really spend too much time really taking in
        photos and learning the story behind them. I think what makes a really great photographer is the ability to capture moments that tell a story all in itself. I think the concept of different interpretations and discussions from photographs
        really tie in with photography as a form of art. Digital images–whether illustrated of photographed–hold so much meaning and intention behind it leaves viewers to understand and learn from it in their own way. The example I saw on <a
          href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/umami-land">Awwwards</a> really showed this with digital illustrations. The way this website was designed made the interaction almost like a video game, with cute and fun illustrations of different
        Japanese foods. I think this execution of digital imagery and user experience made Japanese "exotic" foods a little less intimidating and more interesting. As a result, people may be more inclined to view these foods in a different light and
        have more curiosity on it. </p>

      <h2>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-01-27">Jan 27, 2021</time>
      <p>This article shed light on a design solution that I never really put too much thought into. Since I've been using the internet, I've remembered seeing overlays and lightboxes for things like forms, warnings, and promotions. Reading this
        article gave a really insightful perspective as to why these became so popular and how it benefits the user in certain scenarios. Reading the examples of poor uses for this kind of design really put things into perspective for me in thinking
        about whether or not certain design decisions are even useful or beneficial for users. I think the example with the form use and how users on mobile devices are disadvantaged when filling out full page forms since they have to zoom in all the
        way was really interesting to me since I've personally experienced that pain point without realizing it. </p>

      <h2>Best Practices for form design</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-01-21">Jan 21, 2021</time>
      <p>This article made some interesting points on what is good practice in designing forms. I didn't realize there were a lot of small details that make a huge impact on how readable and intuitive a form can be for a user. I thought it was
        interesting how the main priorities in the designs were to make understanding what to do as easy as possible while minimizing form abandonment. Another thing I thought was interesting was how I've seen forms with the 'bad practices' mentioned
        like the red asterisk on required question, although I don't really see this type of design in more modern forms. I thought the password requirement formatting was very useful to put because I've personally gotten annoyed on vague and
        uncommunicated requirements for passwords. </p>
