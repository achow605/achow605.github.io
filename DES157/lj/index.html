      <h2>Images and Interaction</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-02-03">Feb 3, 2021</time>
      <p>I thought that this article really touched upon the meaning behind "a picture is worth a thousand words". I feel that often we are so exposed to so many forms of media constantly that we don't really spend too much time really taking in photos and learning the story behind them. I think what makes a really great photographer is the ability to capture moments that tell a story all in itself. I think the concept of different interpretations and discussions from photographs really tie in with photography as a form of art. Digital images–whether illustrated of photographed–hold so much meaning and intention behind it leaves viewers to understand and learn from it in their own way. The example I saw on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/umami-land">Awwwards</a> really showed this with digital illustrations. The way this website was designed made the interaction almost like a video game, with cute and fun illustrations of different Japanese foods. I think this execution of digital imagery and user experience made Japanese "exotic" foods a little less intimidating and more interesting. As a result, people may be more inclined to view these foods in a different light and have more curiosity on it. </p>

      <h2>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-01-27">Jan 27, 2021</time>
      <p>This article shed light on a design solution that I never really put too much thought into. Since I've been using the internet, I've remembered seeing overlays and lightboxes for things like forms, warnings, and promotions. Reading this article gave a really insightful perspective as to why these became so popular and how it benefits the user in certain scenarios. Reading the examples of poor uses for this kind of design really put things into perspective for me in thinking about whether or not certain design decisions are even useful or beneficial for users. I think the example with the form use and how users on mobile devices are disadvantaged when filling out full page forms since they have to zoom in all the way was really interesting to me since I've personally experienced that pain point without realizing it. </p>

      <h2>Best Practices for form design</h2>
      <time datetime="2021-01-21">Jan 21, 2021</time>
      <p>This article made some interesting points on what is good practice in designing forms. I didn't realize there were a lot of small details that make a huge impact on how readable and intuitive a form can be for a user. I thought it was interesting how the main priorities in the designs were to make understanding what to do as easy as possible while minimizing form abandonment. Another thing I thought was interesting was how I've seen forms with the 'bad practices' mentioned like the red asterisk on required question, although I don't really see this type of design in more modern forms. I thought the password requirement formatting was very useful to put because I've personally gotten annoyed on vague and uncommunicated requirements for passwords. </p>
