  <h1>User observations</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Looks and colors</h2>
      <p>All three users commented on the looks and overall aesthetics of the project noting that the font choice, color, and layout were great. There were a couple comments on a rather clear hierarchy of elements that is simple and clean. I really
        appreciated the comments I received on this being very polished and there were no major concerns regarding this aspect of the project. </p>
      <p>A suggestion given to me was regarding the button placement on the starting screen, where a larger margin
        between the button and the text will allow for a more obvious call to action. However, I'm not sure how I would approach this since I optimized my page to be viewed on a 1366x768 display which doesn't give me a lot of room to work with.
        Perhaps I will consider adding a small breakpoint to compensate for the extra space that larger displays have.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Intuitive Interactions</h2>
      <p>Overall I didn't really have to ever explain what a certain button was supposed to do or helping the user progress through the whole quiz. From the feedback I received it seemed pretty straightforward after starting the quiz, and users knew
        right away to click the option and go to the next question. </p>
      <p>People really appreciated the progress bar at the top to know how long the quiz is going to take and that they don't need to rush since it's only three questions. I thought that was
        super helpful feedback because I really wanted people to take their time choosing their answer so that they can explore the different animations that are for every option. </p>
      <p>Another thing I noticed was that every person testing the website went
        to do it again and again wanting to see all the options they can get. I thought that was really cool and is something I really liked seeing during user testing.</p>
      <p>There were two moments of confusion during the third question where a user didn't
        know whether or not the starting value was dark mode or light mode and another user got the options mixed up. One thing I will change from this is that I will adjust the wording of the question to better align with what is at default.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Animations and feedback</h2>
      <p>People seemed to like the little animations that would happen when you hover over certain items. On top of the larger animations that happen during some of the questions, people also liked the mini ones in the beginning. People thought it
        was helpful to have the underline animation help show which option is selected or hovered over. </p>
      <p>One notable time was when a user hovered over my name and said that they perfectly expected that to happen as soon as it animated as a link. Along
        with that, people really liked the animated transitions that were added between questions and no interactive elements had any confusion with them. Overall, there were no major suggestions on this part of the project.</p>
